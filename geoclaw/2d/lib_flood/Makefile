# Library version of Makefile
# ---------------------------

# Only "make .objs" and "make .htmls" are useful in this directory.

# Makefile for Clawpack code in this directory.
# This version only sets the local files and frequently changed
# options, and then includes the standard makefile pointed to by CLAWMAKE.
CLAWMAKE = $(CLAW)/util/Makefile.common

# See the above file for details and a list of make options, or type
#   make .help
# at the unix prompt.

# Note: This version uses dynamic memory allocation from f90 and so requires
# an f90 compiler such as gfortran.

# Environment variable FC should be set to fortran compiler, e.g. gfortran
FC ?= gfortran44   # default if not set as environment variable

# Add any desired compiler flags such as -g here:
FFLAGS ?= -O2
