<h1> 
Using a setplot function to set up plotting
</h1>


Most example directories contain a file setplot.py that contains a
function setplot(plotdata). This function
sets various attributes of plotdata
in order to specify how plotting is to be done.

The object plotdata is of class ClawPlotData.  The way to set up the plot
structure is to follow this outline:

<ol>
<li> Specify some attributes of setplot that determine  what sort of plots
will be produced and where they will be stored, e.g.
{{{
plotdata.plotdir = 'plots'
}}}
will cause hardcopy to go to subdirectory plots of the current directory.

There are many other [link:plotdata.html ClawPlotData attributes and methods] 

<li> Specify one or more Figures to be created for each frame, e.g.
{{{
plotfigure = plotdata.new_plotfigure(name='Solution', figno=1)
}}}
plotfigure is now an object of class ClawPlotFigure and various attributes
can be set, e.g., 
{{{
plotfigure.kwargs = {'figsize':[8,12], 'facecolor':'#ffeebb'}
}}}
to specify any keyword arguments 
that should be used when creating this figure in matplotlib.
The above would create a figure that is
8 inches by 12 inches with a tan background.

For more options,
see the matplotlib
documentation for the figure command.

<li> Specify one or more Axes to be created within each figure,
e.g.
{{{
plotaxes = plotfigure.new_plotaxes(name='Pressure')
}}}
Note that new_plotaxes is a method of class ClawPlotFigure and creates a set
of axes specific to the particular object plotfigure.

plotaxes is now an object of class ClawPlotAxes  and various attributes
can be set, e.g.,
{{{
plotfigure.ylim = [-1, 1]
}}}

There are many other [link:plotaxes.html ClawPlotAxes attributes and methods] 


<li> Specify one or more Items to be created within these axes,
e.g.
{{{
plotitem = plotaxes.new_plotitem(name='line')
}}}
Note that new_plotitem is a method of class ClawPlotAxes and creates a plot
object (e.g. line, contour plot, etc)
specific to the particular object plotaxes.

plotitem is now an object of class ClawPlotItem  and various attributes
can be set, e.g.,
{{{
plotitem.plotstyle = '-'
}}}
for a solid line.
