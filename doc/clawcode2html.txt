<h2>Documentation via clawcode2html</h2>

The Python script [link:clawcode2html.py] is used to convert programs, data
files, README files, etc. into html files that can be viewed using a web
browser.

This is a modified version of 
[www.amath.washington.edu/~rjl/mathcode2html mathcode2html], with some
modifications for the Clawpack environment.
